	  <p>This is the work of a enemy stand.......is what can describe this project
	  simply because it is a reference to a show i like to watch. This project, called stick mans odd quest, is meant
	  to be beta and a skeleton for any games that would incorperate fighting moves. The sprites are free to use by anyone. Its functions by having the
	  stick man send a "punching ghost" to attack.</p>

	  <p>This is my third scratch project. It is more of a tribute to the Dark Souls franchise, dedicated to the vast lore it has. This 
	  small story gives a small glimpse into the dark, hallowed world.</p>
